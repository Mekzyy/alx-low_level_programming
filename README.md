ALX-Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

This repo contains programs written for the C low-level programming course @ALX-Africa SE. In these projects, which occurred throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

0x00. C - Hello, World
0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
0x03-debugging
0x04-more functions, nestedloops
0x05-pointers,arrays,strings
0x06-pointers,arrays,strings
0x07-pointers,arrays,strings
0x08-recursion
0x09-static libraries
0x0A-argc, argv
